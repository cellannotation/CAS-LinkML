        description: A cell of the cuboidal epithelium that covers the lens. The cells
          of the lens epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of the
          lens. As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor,
          Na+/K+ ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens
          to maintain appropriate lens osmolarity and volume, with equatorially positioned
          lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of
          the Na+/K+ ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from
          the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens
          epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly
          lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues
          to lay down fibers for lifelong growth.

          peripheral glia. Ultrastructurally, the most conspicuous trait of an enteroglial

          form axial bundles in the processes and appear to firmly anchor the cells

          of the lung and is involved in the sensory detection of environmental stimuli,
          including hypoxia, nicotine and air pressure. Ultrastructurally, this cell
          type is characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic dense core granules,
          which are considered the storage sites of amine and peptide hormones. Lung
          neuroendocrine cells are innervated and appear as solitary cells or as clustered
          masses, localized at airway bifurcation sites, called neuroepithelial bodies
          that can release serotonin in response to hypoxia and interact with sensory
          nerve terminals. Lung neuroendocrine cells also function as reserve stem
          cells that repair the surrounding epithelium after injury.

          of the cochlea, and is located beneath Claudius cells. A Boettcher cell
          is considered a supporting cell for the organ of Corti, and is present only
          in the lower turn of the cochlea. These cells interweave with each other,
          and project microvilli into the intercellular space. Because of their structural
          specialization, a Boettcher cell is believed to play a significant role
          in the function of the cochlea. They demonstrate high levels of calmodulin,
